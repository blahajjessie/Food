## Nerd shit:
- I want to write some code that generates a table of contents (and maybe a searchable form of this?)
- [template.md](template.md) also exists so all these can look kinda similar

## Why does this exist?
I've made food for a few of my friends, and sometimes they ask me how I did it. Usually, I don't know, or can't remember everything I put in it.

About me:
I am a student at UCSC and I really like to cook!
All of these recipes are based on something somebody else wrote, but some of them are starting to become mine.
Every recipe is something that ive made before, and either modified, or something ive made myself.
