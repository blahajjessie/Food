3. add most of the sauce to the pasta, and mix.
4. add to a large oven safe dish
5. pour the remaining sauce on the edge of the pasta. this will prevent burning.
6. add the last 8 oz of cheese on top, grated

9. cook until golden brown, check every 10 minutes
10. if you're in a rush, or want the top extra crispy, use your broiler.
